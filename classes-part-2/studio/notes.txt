class Menu : constructor should take a title and default to current LocalDate for created
    String menuTitle (e.g., Lunch, Dinner?)
    arrayList menuItems = blank arrayList
    LocalDate created = date the object is created

    LocalDate updated = blank;
    method addItemToMenu = (item) => menuItems.push(item), this.updated = LocalDate

class menuItems
    Float price
    String description
    Array category = appetizer, main course, or dessert
        consider making an arrayList if categories are ever likely to change or expand,
        e.g., beverages, cocktails, pastries, etc.
    Boolean if current date is sooner than last updated date, set to true, else false
